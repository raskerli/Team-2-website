     <br>Hello, I am Javanshir Hashimov, a first-year student of the Bachelor's degree at the Faculty of Computer Science of ADA University. I was born on January 3 in Shirvan, Azerbaijan. I studied at secondary school number 16 named after B. Aslanov. I value my free time with playing chess, and I think Chess is a passion. I have been playing chess professionally for more than 12 years.
At the same time, another thing that manages to attract my attention is computers, their working principle and programming languages. My first acquaintance with a computer was when I was 5 years old, and since then I have been interested in this wonderful device. <br> <br>
